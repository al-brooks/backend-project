# DigitalCrafts Week Nine Backend Project: Movie Review App

## App Name: MOVIE SCOOP

app link: https://movie-scoop-01284.herokuapp.com/

## App Description:

A web application for movie lovers. Users can create an account, search for their favorite movies, see reviews mafe for that movie by other users, and then leave their own. Their User Account page will list out all the reviews they've posted, along with basic info.

## Motivation

We created this application because we wanted to create a movie review app that was user-driven and had a pleasant UI. Our movie review app gives users the opportunity to share their review on movies they have seen, as well as non-users the ability to search our site for their favorite movies.

## Features

The App landing page provides the option to login as an User/Guest or to sign up on the App. Movie Scoop give you an abundance of movies to see the details, ratings, and reviews.
